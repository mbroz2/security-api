/**
 * The RememberMe annotation provides an application the ability to declaratively designate
 * that an authentication mechanism effectively "remembers" the authentication and auto
 * applies this with every request.
 *
 * <p>
 * For the remember me function the credentials provided by the caller are exchanged for a (long-lived) token
 * which is send to the user as the value of a cookie, in a similar way to how the HTTP session ID is send.
 * It should be realized that this token effectively becomes the credential to establish the caller's
 * identity within the application and care should be taken to handle and store the token securely. E.g.
 * by using this feature with a secure transport (SSL/HTTPS), storing a strong hash instead of the actual
 * token, and implementing an expiration policy.
 *
 * <p>
 * The token is vended by a special purpose {@link IdentityStore}-like artifact; an implementation of the
 * {@link RememberMeIdentityStore}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This support is provided via an implementation of an interceptor spec interceptor that conducts the
 * necessary logic.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     {@literal @}RequestScoped
 *     {@literal @}RememberMe
 *     public class CustomAuthenticationMechanism implements HttpAuthenticationMechanism {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Jakarta Expression Language expressions in attributes of type <code>String</code> are evaluated for every request requiring
 * authentication. Both immediate and deferred syntax is supported, but effectively the semantics
 * are always deferred.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> this facility <em>DOES NOT</em> constitute any kind of "session management" system, but instead
 * represents a special purpose authentication mechanism using a long-lived token, that is vended and validated by the
 * {@link RememberMeIdentityStore}.
 *
