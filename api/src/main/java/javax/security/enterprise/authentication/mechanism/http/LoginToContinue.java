/**
 * The <code>LoginToContinue</code> annotation provides an application the ability to declaratively
 * add login to continue functionality to an authentication mechanism.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the <code>LoginToContinue</code> annotation is used on a custom authentication mechanism, EL
 * expressions in attributes of type <code>String</code> are evaluated for every request requiring
 * authentication. Both immediate and deferred syntax is supported, but effectively the semantics
 * are always deferred.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the <code>LoginToContinue</code> annotation is used as attribute in either the
 * {@link FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition} or {@link CustomFormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition},
 * expressions using immediate syntax are evaluated only once when the {@link HttpAuthenticationMechanism}
 * bean is created. Since these beans are application scoped, this means only once per application.
 * Expressions using deferred syntax are evaluated as described above when the <code>LoginToContinue</code> annotation
 * is used on a custom authentication mechanism.
