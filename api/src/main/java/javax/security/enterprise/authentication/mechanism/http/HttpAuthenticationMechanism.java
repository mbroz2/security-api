/**
 * <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> is a mechanism for obtaining a caller's
 * credentials in some way, using the HTTP protocol where necessary.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is used to help in securing Jakarta Servlet endpoints, including
 * endpoints that may be build on top of Jakarta Servlets like Jakarta RESTful Web Services endpoints and 
 * Jakarta Faces views. It specifically <b>is not</b> used for endpoints such as remote Jakarta Enterprise Beans
 * or (Jakarta Messaging) message driven beans.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> is essentially a Jakarta Servlet specific and CDI enabled version of
 * the {@link ServerAuthModule} that adheres to the Servlet Container Profile. See the Jakarta Authentication spec for 
 * further details on this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class can notify the Jakarta Servlet container about a successful authentication by using the
 * {@link HttpMessageContext#notifyContainerAboutLogin(java.security.Principal, java.util.Set)} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations are expected and encouraged to delegate the actual credential validation and/or retrieval of the
 * caller name with optional groups to an {@link IdentityStore}. This is however <b>not</b> required and implementations
 * can either do the validation checks for authentication completely autonomously, or delegate only certain aspects of
 * the process to the store (e.g. use the store only for retrieving the groups an authenticated user is in).
